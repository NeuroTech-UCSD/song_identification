## Usage 
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
- In [`/scripts`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/scripts), `python main.py` will run the app.
- Upload the entire project folder to Google drive, and open the .ipynb files in Colab to run the demo notebooks.

## Github Directories
![](./figures/github_schema.png)
- [`/data`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/data) - Where the recorded eeg data, intermediate variables, and analysis results for plotting the figures will be stored. 
	- [`/data/eeg_recordings`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/data/eeg_recordings) - Contains different sessions of EEG recordings.
- [`/figures`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/figures) Stores all of the figures generated by the scripts. 
- [`/notebooks`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/notebooks) Demo notebooks illustrating the data processing and modeling pipeline. 
- [`/scripts`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/scripts) Each script is for a particular processing stage.
	- [`/scripts/main.py`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/blob/main/scripts/main.py) - The scripts that runs the entire project pipeline, combining all of the processing scripts.
- [`/src`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/tree/main/src) - Modular code files that are meant to be imported by different scripts.
	- [`/src/funcs.py`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/blob/main/src/funcs.py) - Modular data processing functions for the script files to use.
	- [`/src/utils.py`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/blob/main/src/utils.py) - Modular utility functions such as ploting, loading, and saving the data.
	- [`/src/custom_module.py`](https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Project-Template/blob/main/src/custom_module.py) - Can have different names. Where we define custom classes for modeling, GUI, etc.

## App Flow
Describe the app processing stages with figures and screenshots of the app.

## Mapping of Electrodes
Describe the mapping of electrodes with a mapping figure and a real-life photo of the setup.

## Modules
Descriptions of different parts of the projects worth noting, each with its own subtitle.
